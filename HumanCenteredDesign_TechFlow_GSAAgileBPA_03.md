Purpose and Overview
====================

> Drug and Adverse Reaction Information (DARI) is a data driven
> application based on reported adverse events and drug information.
> After determining the niche of our application, we ensured that our
> focus would be relevant to our end users through a systematic design
> process and several user interface design heuristics.

Techniques 
===========

Brainstorming and Preliminary Research

-   From expert interviews and preliminary research on the topic, the
    user interest centering the drug risks and histories that have
    affected other users served as a priority need to address. While we
    found that expert users - i.e. those who regularly take prescription
    medication - are very familiar with reading labeling information,
    reinforcing information about the drug would be a benefit for our
    users to know. Essentially, users would benefit from adverse events
    data along with a more streamlined *labeling* section in order to
    reinforce their decision making with user driven data.

User Personas and User Stories

-   In order for the team to consolidate an understanding of our end
    users, we began with a user persona session and visualized their
    user stories through storyboards. We referred to these user stories
    throughout the design process. Below is a list of the user personas:

I.  General User

II. Medical Professional

III. Legal Professional

Tools 
======

> Rapid Prototyping and Feedback

-   Low fidelity prototyping afforded instant human-centered feedback.
    Several iterations on early paper prototypes were evaluated and
    adjusted after critique from users and the team. User feedback early
    in the design process allows for agile changes before fully
    implementing the prototype.

Usability Testing

-   Further usability testing on the high fidelity prototypes and final
    product provided insight into the flow of the application and how
    our users interact with the product.

User Interface Design 
======================

This section will break down several design principles which our website
application achieves. By abiding to these heuristics, we afford the
application with features that prioritizes user needs and behaviors to
decrease the learning delta and increase efficiency of use.

-   **Visibility**: The primary functions of the application are made
    clearly visible to the user. For example, the initial search is
    provided as the only visible function on the landing page because
    other pages are hidden to the user until the query is evoked. We
    ensure not to clutter the page with too many features on any one
    section.

-   **Feedback**: Whenever the page is loading, we provide visual
    feedback back to the user. Other forms of feedback is given by the
    correct error messages if the data does not load correctly.

-   **Constraints***:* Restricting the user from entering invalid search
    queries through the auto-complete feature guarantees only valid
    searches. We constrain the user to the top suggested options
    inasmuch as the user continues to type in correct spellings of the
    beginning search word.

-   **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: White space allows for a
    streamlined look of the information with a 3-color palette to keep
    the application “easy on the eyes”. The use of other colors in the
    adverse event section attracts the user’s attention while the
    minimalist look makes the information easily legible and not
    overwhelming.

-   **Error Prevention***:* The auto-correct feature prevents invalid
    searches. If the entire application does not load or if there are
    loading issues, the application does not display any information.
