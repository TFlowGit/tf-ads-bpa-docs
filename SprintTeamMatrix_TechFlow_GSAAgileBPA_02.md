Purpose and Overview
====================

The purpose of this document is to familiarize the reader with the team
assembled by TechFlow for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
support of the Drug and Risk Information (DARI) public information
website. It includes a matrix of team resource labor category,
functional designation and hours dedicated to the project.

Sprint team members have functional managers that assign the projects;
the product owner, however, leads the day-to-day delivery of project
driven tasks.

The Team 
=========

The TechFlow team was comprised of the 13 labor categories; below are
team member roles as well as their functional designation.

Sprint Team Flexibility 
========================

While TechFlow has dedicated sprint teams we are nimble enough to adjust
sprint team size based on priority, complexity and size of the project.
